			ANTHROPOMORPHISM
===============================================================================

IDENTITY
	- The agent might have a name and a history to create the illusion of a
	living creatures.
	- this helps build the idea of a persistent being with a consistent behaviour
	and character 

BODY / VOICE / ETC
	The agent often has a body, with custom skin design, to make it seem
	human. Duplicate column doesn't yet speak to us !

OBJECTIVE
	the agent might have an objective like "taking you down", while a
	usual function just waits for orders

ANIMATION
	to make it more real, the agent is animated and makes unecessary moves
	but similar to the "real world" version of the "game ai"

HUMAN SIMULATION
	the agent can be orders of magnitude faster than a human to act. So to
	balance it, the developpers may limit its actions : add delays, make it
	imprecize, etc

===============================================================================
			INTERACTIONS
===============================================================================

AUTONOMOUS
	The agent can act on its own, without any intervention from the user.
	Rather, it automatically adapts to the human's actions / state.

COMMUNICATION
	the user/player often interacts with the game agent the same way it would
	with a human player.

OPPOSITION
	it can refuse to act like you want it to ! chrome has never said "ok now,
	enough hanging around !" and closing my tabs ^^

===============================================================================
			DECISION TAKING
===============================================================================

CONVOLUTED
	most of the time, we expect the "game ai" to be unpredictable, particularly
	when its an opponent. might tend on the reliable side when it's ally

FAR REACHING
	the agent doesn't just take elementary actions one after another, it may
	follow a plan to achieve some goal ; it should be more evolved than a
	glouton !

KNOWLEDGE
	like a human, the agent often has a limited knowledge of the world : it
	must take action to get information. While the game engine could give it
	the entirety of the game state
